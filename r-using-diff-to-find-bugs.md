## PROMPT: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Instead of reading through a large file by hand, using the git diff command allowed me to se the explicit differences between two files. To use the command, begin with the git command followed by the action of `diff`. diff takes two arguments, the first should be the older version of the file, and the second should be the newer version. Ultimately the order doesn't matter, but using them in this manner allows the user to see the changes made as time went on instead of the changes working back into the past.
