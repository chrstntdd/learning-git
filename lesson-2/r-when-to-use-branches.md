### What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches allow more risks to be taken in development. The master branch is the default branch that should always consist of a working version of the project to be able to present it if needed. Should new ideas be introduced they should be implemented on a different branch so as to not pollute the working commit and cause any unwanted side effects. The separate branch simply allows a different safe space to experiment without adversely affecting the working project.
