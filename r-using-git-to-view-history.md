#### How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

To view the history of files with git, all one needs is the hash info for the two files to be compared. These can be found using the ``` git log ``` command. This will return a list of commits with their corresponding hash and commit message. Remember to press q to exit the log, then begin typing ```git diff``` on the next line. This command requires the two different hashes, so copy and paste the two commit's id into the current command, separated by a space. The syntax should be similar to ```git diff b0678b1 f19cb1b```. The first argument should usually be the older commit, while the second argument is the newer commit. This order is useful for tracking forward progress through a project because it will show the changes implemented in the order they were committed.
