### How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area sits **between** the working directory and the repository tracked with git. This is incredibly valuable because it lets the user organize the commit even before it is committed to the repository. Since commits are supposed to consist of a single logical change, being able to consolidate all the files that make up this change in once place before committing further solidifies this convention.
