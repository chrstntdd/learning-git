### When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository allows git to be so powerful in the world of software, particularly in open source. With a remote area for code to exist, multiple people can access and update the contents of that repository so that the project can either be expanded, corrected, or altered in any way. Commits are sent to the repository on GitHub through the ```git push``` command and to retrieve any commits made to that repository (the one on GitHub) that don't exist in your local copy, the command is ```git pull``` .
